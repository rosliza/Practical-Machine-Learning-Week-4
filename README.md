Hi...

This repository is intended for Coursera Practical Machine Learning Week 4 Assignment Project Submission.

Enclosed together with this readme.md file are the following files:

1. rawdataset folder (contains 2 files, pml-testing.csv and pml-training.csv. These files are raw data provided by Coursera)
2. rosliza_c8_week4a.Rmd (is a rmarkdown file, it is the program/code that I have created for this assignment using rStudio)

Thank you.
